### Bugs to fix 
- [x] Merging animation not working
- [x] Animations can get canceled if user inputs a lot of movements in a short period of time. This results in the tiles being stuck mid animation
- [x] If tile is on the top of the grid and another tile with the same value in the same column at the bottom of the grid tries to merge by either going up or going down no animation will play and it will just merge the tiles values.
